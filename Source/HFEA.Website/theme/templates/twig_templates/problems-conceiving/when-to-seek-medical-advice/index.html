	<h4>
		If you are a woman these may include:
	</h4>
	<ul class="mb-20">
		<li>
			a cervical smear test if you haven’t had one recently
		</li>
		<li>
			a urine test for chlamydia, which can block your fallopian tubes, preventing you from
			becoming pregnant
		</li>
		<li>
			a blood test to see if you are ovulating (this is done by measuring progesterone in
			a blood sample taken seven days before your period is due)
		</li>
		<li>
			a blood test to check for German measles (Rubella) which, if contracted during the
			first three months of pregnancy can harm your unborn baby
		</li>
		<li>
			a blood test during your period to check for hormone imbalances – measuring follicle
			stimulating hormone (FSH),luteinising hormone (LH)and oestradiol.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>
		For men initial tests may include:
	</h4>
	<ul class="mb-20">
		<li>
			a urine test for chlamydia, which, as well as being a known cause of infertility in women, can also affect sperm function and male fertility
		</li>
		<li>
			a referral to your local hospital or fertility clinic for a sperm testto check for poor morphology(abnormal shape), poor motility (not moving normally), or both.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>
		What happens if my test results are normal?
	</h4>
	<p class="mb-20">
		If your test results are normal and you have been trying for a baby for less than 18 months, your GP may suggest you make a few lifestyle changes and continue trying to conceive naturally.
	</p>
	<h4>
		What if the tests are positive?
	</h4>
	<p class="mb-20">
		If the tests reveal a possible fertility issue, especially if you are in your 30s or older, they may make an appointment for you to see a specialist for further tests. This could be at your local hospital or at a fertility clinic, where you would also go on to have treatment if necessary 
	</p>
	<h4>
		What tests might I have at my local hospital if I am a woman?
	</h4>
	<ul class="mb-20">
		<li>
			a full hormone profile to measure any hormone imbalance
		</li>
		<li>
			blood tests to find out whether you are ovulating
		</li>
		<li>
			an ultrasound scan to look at your womb and ovaries
		</li>
		<li>
			follicle tracking – a series of ultrasound scans to follow the development of a follicle to
			see if an egg is developing
		</li>
		<li>
			hysterosalpingogram – an x-ray to check your fallopian tubes
		</li>
		<li>
			laparoscopy – an operation to check for any blockages in the fallopian tubes
		</li>
		<li>
			hysteroscopy – a procedure which involves using a telescope with a camera
			attached to view your uterus to check for conditions such as fibroids or polyps
		</li>

	<p >
		When there is a fertility problem in men, this is usually linked to low numbers or poor quality of sperm. This might be due to past medical treatments, genetic abnormalities or lifestyle factors, but more often than not there is no obvious cause.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-20">
		In women the causes of fertility problems are more varied. They include the failure to release an egg every month (to ovulate), endometriosis, damage to the fallopian tubes, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy) – a scan which uses a vaginal ultrasound
			probe to check the fallopian tubes for blockages
		</li>
		<li>
			occasionally, a tissue sample may be taken from the endometrium lining of your uterus to be analysed.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		For men, these may include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			blood tests to find out the reason for any sperm abnormalities
		</li>
		<li>
			karyotyping – a test to examine chromosomes
		</li>
		<li>
			a testicular biopsy to find out the reason for a low sperm count.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If you are unable to produce sperm, you may have surgical sperm retrieval – a procedure to
		remove sperm from the epididymis or the testicles – so that diagnostic tests can be performed
	</p>
