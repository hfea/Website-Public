<p>
Your partner (if you have one), family and friends can of course be a wonderful source of comfort and for some people that’s enough. However, most people find it helpful to get extra support from a counsellor or people who have direct experience of their situation, particularly if that situation is unusual or rare. Meeting and talking to others who can relate to exactly what you’re going through is a type of support your loved ones might not be able to offer.

<h3>
	Clinics
	
</h3>
<P>
	

Because fertility treatment is such a complicated process, all clinics licensed by us must offer you an opportunity to talk to a counsellor before you start treatment. Some clinics offer this for free whilst others charge for it. When you’re researching clinics you might want to ask about this and whether they offer any support groups or opportunities to chat to other patients who are undergoing similar treatment. 
</P>

<h3>
	

Support groups
</h3>

<p>
	

Joining a support group is a great way of meeting people with similar circumstances to your own who will understand what you’re going through. Your GP or fertility clinic should be able to advise you on groups in your area, or you can contact Infertility Network UK. 
</p>

<h3>
	
Counselling
</h3>

<p>
	

All clinics licensed by us must offer you an opportunity to talk to a counsellor. This will help you to understand exactly what your treatment will involve and how it might affect you and those close to you – now and in the future. This is especially important if you’re thinking about using donated sperm, eggs or embryos or surrogacy arrangements as they involve a lot of complicated issues. 
</p>
<p>
	
On top of counselling from your clinic, you might want to consider getting additional counselling on the NHS or privately. This will give you more of an opportunity to explore your feelings around fertility treatment more generally, and is something you ca do on your own or with your partner (if you have one). Talk to your GP about getting counselling on the NHS or if you’d prefer to go private, The British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy (bacp) has a <a href="#">directory</a> of accredited therapists.

How can I access support groups?
</h3>

<p>
