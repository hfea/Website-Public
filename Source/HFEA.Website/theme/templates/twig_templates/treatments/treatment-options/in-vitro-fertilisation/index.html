	* If you’re under 35 using a ‘blastocyst’ stage embryo can increase your chances of success, but embryos can also stop developing at day two so it might be safer to move them to your womb at an earlier stage – your doctor can advise on the best option for you.

<p>
If you’re having IVF there are a number of different options you might like to consider and discuss with your doctor.  
</p>
<h3 class="black-text">
ICSI
</h3> 
<p>
This option may be suitable for men with fertility problems, such as those who produce less sperm, don’t ejaculate or whose sperm is of an unusual shape or movement.
</p>
<h3 class="black-text">
Natural cycle IVF
</h3>
<p> This type of treatment involves no fertility drugs so it may be suitable for women who are unable to take them (due to health reasons for example) or who choose not to.
</p>
<h3 class="black-text">
Mild stimulation IVF
</h3>
<p> This type of treatment involves taking fewer fertility drugs than normal, so may be suitable for women who are particularly at risk from having a bad reaction to fertility drugs. Talk to your doctor about whether this applies to you.
</p>
<h3 class="black-text">
Blastocyst transfer
</h3>
<p> This is suitable for younger women with a good chance of getting pregnant through IVF and for women who have produced good quality embryos in a previous cycle, which didn’t implant in the womb. 
</p>
<h3 class="black-text">
Assisted hatching
</h3>
<p>
This may be suitable for older women undergoing IVF however the lack of evidence means it is not currently a recommended treatment. 
</p>
<h3 class="black-text">
Risks of IVF treatment
</h3>
<p>
The main risks from IVF treatment are multiple pregnancies (having twins, triplets or more); having a bad reaction to fertility drugs and having an ectopic pregnancy (where the baby develops outside of the womb). Some of these can be fatal to you, the baby or both so make sure you understand all the risks and when to seek medical help.
