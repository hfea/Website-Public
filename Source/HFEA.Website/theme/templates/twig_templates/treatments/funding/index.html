If you are eligible for, and wouldlike, NHS-funded treatment, your first step is to get a referral from your GP.

There isn’t an easy answer to this question as we don’t regulate the cost of treatment; private clinics set their own costs so prices can vary.
</p>
<p>
	
If you are unable to access NHS funding for your fertility treatment or are planning to pay
for your own, you have the option of directly approaching private fertility clinics. Depending on your situation, you may still want to visit your GP first to have initial tests or discussions (more about this in ‘How and when to seek fertility treatment’).
</p>
<p>
	
You will need to contact clinics directly to find out how much your treatment will cost.
When discussing prices with clinics, it’s important to find out exactly what the price includes.
Some include consultation fees and any recommended tests in their overall price; others may not. Some clinics may offer some free counselling, and others may
charge for this. Fertility drugs are usually an extra cost and can be very expensive. The cost of your treatment may also change as your treatment progresses. Make sure your clinic provides you with a costed treatment plan detailing the specific procedures you need.

What about Treatment abroad
You may be considering travelling abroad for fertility treatment due to, for example, lower costs. If so, it’s important to bear in mind that the standard of clinics in overseas
countries varies greatly and not all countries will have organisations equivalent to the HFEA. Some places have no specific laws or regulations relating to fertility treatment as we do in the UK.
If you are considering this option, we advise you to carry out thorough research beforehand and only select a clinic that has a proven record on quality and safety standards.
