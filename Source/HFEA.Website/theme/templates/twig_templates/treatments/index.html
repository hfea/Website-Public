Fertility treatments fall into three broad categories: drugs which boost the number of eggs a woman produces; assisted conception which involves manually fertilising your eggs outside the body or surgery to address a problem in the body, such as a blocked fallopian tube. Your treatment may involve one, two or all three of these approaches depending on your situation and the reason you’re having treatment. '

					Your GP or clinic should be able to advise you on the best treatment option for you. Some couples and individuals will start by trying one type of treatment, such as IVF, and if that’s not successful will then look at other options such as IUI, surrogacy or using donated eggs or sperm in their treatment. You might also want to consider having additional treatments such as embryo testing if you have a serious inherited disease in your family.
