	<h3>Medical conditions</h3>
	<p class="mb-20">
		Common reasons why couples have problems getting pregnant range from gynaecological problems to low sperm count.

				Cancer, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, chlamydia, diabetes, epilepsy and thyroid and bowel diseases; conditions affecting the uterus; gynaecological problems such as previous ectopic pregnancy or having had more than one miscarriage; other problems with ovulation (the monthly release of the egg), sexually transmitted diseases

				A lower sperm count, or sperm with an unusual shape or movement; diabetes; a past bacterial infection; problems with the tubes carrying sperm; difficulty getting an erection or ejaculating; having had inflamed testes (orchitis); having received medical treatment such as drug treatment, radiotherapy or surgery – for example to correct a hernia, undescended testes or twisted testicles; sexually transmitted diseases

			<h4>
				Age
			</h4>
			<p>
				The age of the woman has a major impact on your chances of getting pregnant. Of women aged 35 and under who have regular unprotected sexual intercourse, 95% will get pregnant within three years, while by the age of 38 only 75% of women will do so. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h4>
				Lifestyle factors
			</h4>
			<p>
				Lifestyle factors such as being overweight or underweight, smoking, drinking, stress or having a job that involves contact with chemicals or radiation can all lessen your chances of getting pregnant. Visit NHS Choices for more information on preparing your body for pregnancy.

Since then I’ve started a course of fertility drugs and have been meeting lots of other women who have a similar condition to me, some of whom have gotten pregnant and some who haven’t. Realistically I know I might never be able to have children, but just feeling back in control and supported by people who ‘get it’ is a massive help.',
