						The Authority is our board. Its membership includes our senior management team and external professionals with relevant expertise. The full board has experience spanning the medical sciences, philosophy, the law and public service, as well as lay members with personal experience of fertility treatment
					</p>
					<p>
						Members meet six times a year and have responsibility for our overall strategic direction. They also decide policy on a wide range of issues from licensing and inspection to fertility treatments and human embryo research. These decisions are central to the way fertility clinics and research centres work and matter to the thousands of people who have fertility treatment in the UK every year.
